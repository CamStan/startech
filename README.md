#### Vision Statement ####

> For international certification companies who need to manage memberships, certifications, and client accessibility. The International Professional Groomers web service (IPG) is a publically available web application containing all that is necessary for the managing, certifying, informing, and locating of professional groomers all over the world; providing a valuable resource for IPG admin, pet groomers, and clients alike. This application will assist IPG admin in the certification of new members, as well as the creating and updating accounts and the management of already certified members. Secondly, this application will provide a simple and organized way for potential members to begin their certification process and for already certified members to update and upgrade their certifications. Lastly, this application will provide a variety of convenient ways for clients to search for and find all needed information about IPG members in their area or area of choice. Unlike the current lack of pet groomer websites, our product will provide an easy-to-use centralized hub for the entire spectrum of user needs regarding professional groomers.
