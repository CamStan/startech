Conduct a Safety Check

    * Anonymous check using 0-4 sent to one person to determine how comfortable we feel with talking and sharing.
       * Team average: 3 
          * Discussion of a few general things that might make us uncomfortable


What did you learn from the sprint?

    * Not to place too many constraints on the project.
    * Try to avoid heavy crossover between team members’ user stories.
    * Not to delete other’s code
    * Communicate better between team members, especially when what I’m trying to work on might affect code someone else is working on as well
    * VSTS can be overwhelming when it’s full of large, vague stories
    * What one person thinks a user story means, might not be how someone else interprets it
    * Quantity kills, choose quality


What still puzzles you?

    * Effort is still ambiguous
       * How do you know how long something is really going to take you?


What can the team do better during the next sprint? Make a specific action plan.

    * Estimations needs to be more accurate
       * Include set-up time, time for commenting code, merging, testing, beautify
    * Communication needs to improve
       * Can use Slack, phone, text, Discord
       * Be very careful when changing someone else’s code (if you do)
       * Comment, comment, comment
    * Be realistic in your abilities and what you think you can do
       * Don’t overestimate your abilities
    * Narrow the user stories so they involve fewer individual pieces.


Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team 

    * Not at this time.
