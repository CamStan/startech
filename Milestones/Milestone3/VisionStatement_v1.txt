Vision Statement 1.0

For international certification companies who need to manage memberships, 
certifications, and client accessibility. The International Professional 
Groomers Membership and Management Directory and Information System (IPGMMDIS) (WIP) 
is a web application that will allow for searching and the display of certified
members and their detailed information, allow the creation and editing of member 
profiles, allow a company update and maintain data, and collect reporting 
information on the respective members. Unlike current certification websites,
our product will provide a more user friendly way for both users and administrators 
to manage certifications and memberships.
